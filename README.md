# boneful
A wrapper for the bone router that provides a clean and fast way to document endpoints.

See doc.go for why we did it this way, and run `go test` to generate a simple sample doc file.

This work was originally done at the Achievement Network and open-sourced there as part of the [go-util](https://github.com/AchievementNetwork/go-util) package.

This updates it and pulls it into its own repository.

You can see examples of it in use at AchievementNetwork's github in the [Vasco](https://github.com/AchievementNetwork/vasco) and [Static](https://github.com/AchievementNetwork/static) projects.
